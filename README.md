# python-api-challenge
This repository holds information for edX data analytics bootcamp module 6 Python APIs. 
To utalize this file you must launch jupyter notebook and navigate to each of the following files:
python-api-challenge/Starter_Code/starter_code/WeatherPy.ipynb
python-api-challenge/Starter_Code/starter_code/VacationPy.ipynb

These codes rely on an API key. You will have to create your own through the appropriate APIs and supply in a config file. 
-https://openweathermap.org/
-https://www.geoapify.com/

Once keys are approved and supplied in configuration files,  you may use jupyter UI to run each cell.

The data in the code provided is pulled from Open weather map API and geoapify API. The list of cities was randomly pulled, and "Perfect Weather" is of the opinion of the author, Me, Cody Allison.
